# ansible-mso

The `ansible-mso` project provides an Ansible collection for managing and automating your Cisco ACI Multi-Site environment.
It consists of a set of modules and roles for performing tasks related to ACI Multi-Site.

This collection has been tested and supports MSO 2.1+.
Modules supporting new features introduced in MSO API in specific MSO versions might not be supported in earlier MSO releases.

*Note: This collection is not compatible with versions of Ansible before v2.8.*

## Requirements
- Ansible v2.9 or newer

## Install
Ansible must be installed
```
sudo pip install ansible
```

Install the collection
```
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.mso
```

## Use
Once the collection is installed, you can use it in a playbook by specifying the full namespace path to the module, plugin and/or role.
```yaml
- hosts: mso
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - name: Add a new site EPG
    cisco.mso.mso_schema_site_anp_epg:
      host: mso_host
      username: admin
      password: SomeSecretPassword
      schema: Schema1
      site: Site1
      template: Template1
      anp: ANP1
      epg: EPG1
      state: present
    delegate_to: localhost
```

## Update
Getting the latest/nightly collection build

### First Approach
Clone the ansible-mso repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-mso.git
```

Go to the ansible-mso directory
```
cd ansible-mso
```

Pull the latest master on your mso
```
git pull origin master
```

Build and Install a collection from source
```
ansible-galaxy collection build --force
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco-mso-* --force
```

### Second Approach
Go to: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-mso/actions
Select the latest CI build
Under Artifacts download collection and unzip it using Terminal or Console. 
*Note: The collection file is a zip file containing a tar.gz file. We recommend using CLI because some GUI-based unarchiver might unarchive both nested archives in one go.

Install the unarchived tar.gz file
```
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco-mso-1.0.0.tar.gz —-force
```
